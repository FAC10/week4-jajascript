# Nobel Prize Laureates Autocomplete

### User Story v.1.0 ###
I would be able to input text into a text input field which will give me back sensible suggestion as I type.

### User Story v.1.1 ###
The user should be able to enter a string into an input box which gives back a list of nobel prize laureates, so that they can easily search for people who have won the nobel prize

## Our Approach
  First we thought about the overall structure of our code, including:
  * Modularisation
  * Testing
  * File Structure
  * Deploying on Heroku


Technical spike: we researched whether we'd want to keep our data in the backend or make a call to an API, along with which data we'd use/ what the function of our autocomplete would be.

Outcome: we'd use our own object with our own data structure in the backend
